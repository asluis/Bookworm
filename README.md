# Bookworm
An app to help the user keep track of the books they've read and what they thought about them.

## What it does
The user enteres a book title, author, genre, and their own personal rating/review into the app and the app stores that information for the user to review later.

## Custom Rating
User clicks on stars to represent how much they liked the book.

## Technologies Explored
This app used Core Data to store the book information the user entered, which allowed for local storage of the information. 
Using Core Data means I also used NSSortDescriptor to sort through the list of books.
